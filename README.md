This include a practice screen developed using HTML and SCSS 

#HTML
HTML can run by just opening the HTML file in web browser , or if you are running it using code you can use live server of VS code

#SCSS
HTML will though contain a compiled version of the SCSS , You can use any scss compiler for your use , I've use VS code extension "Live SASS COMPILER"
